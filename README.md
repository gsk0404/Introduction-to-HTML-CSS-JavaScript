# Minimalist Triple Monitor Desktop Setup

**Description**
A sleek, high-tech desktop environment featuring three monitors. Each display shows a specialized interface: live code, a network topology map, and a glowing digital lock iconâ€”all set against a dark blue, black, and white palette for a modern, focused, and ultra-realistic look.

## Features

- Triple monitor layout
   - Left: Live coding environment (IDE/text editor in dark mode)
   - Center: Network topology visualization software (e.g., GNS3, draw.io, Visio)
   - Right: Wallpaper or screensaver of a glowing digital lock icon

- Minimalist desk and cable management
- High-contrast, clean color scheme: dark blue, black, white
- Subtle ambient LED lighting for a futuristic feel

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware**
   - 3x thin-bezel monitors (same size for best effect)

3. **Aesthetics**
